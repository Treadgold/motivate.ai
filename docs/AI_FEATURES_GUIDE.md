## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

**AI Agent Service** (`backend/services/ai_agent_simple.py`)
- State machine-based workflow processing
- Ollama LLM integration for analysis
- Function calling with task management tools
- Fallback analysis when AI unavailable

**API Endpoints** (`backend/api/ai_agent_api.py`)
- `POST /ai-agent/preview` - Generate task splitting preview
- `POST /ai-agent/execute/{preview_id}` - Execute approved split
- `GET /ai-agent/status` - Check system health
- `DELETE /ai-agent/preview/{preview_id}` - Cancel preview

**Enhanced Task Management** (`backend/api/tasks.py`)
- Complete CRUD operations
- Bulk task creation for subtasks
- Individual task management
- Project-aware operations

### Frontend Components

**AI Split Dialog** (`desktop/ui/ai_split_dialog.py`)
- Modal dialog with beautiful design
- Scrollable content for large analyses
- Loading animations and error handling
- Preview approval workflow

**Main Window Integration** (`desktop/ui/main_window.py`)
- Smart button visibility based on task complexity
- AI status monitoring and display
- Success notifications and error handling
- Background API communication

## 🎯 AI Analysis Process

### 1. **Data Gathering**
- Retrieves complete task details
- Analyzes project context
- Reviews existing project tasks
- Considers user preferences

### 2. **Intelligent Analysis**
- Evaluates task complexity and scope
- Identifies logical breakdown points
- Considers time and energy requirements
- Avoids duplication with existing tasks

### 3. **Proposal Generation**
- Creates optimally-sized subtasks (5-20 minutes each)
- Assigns appropriate priorities and contexts
- Provides clear reasoning for decisions
- Generates confidence scores

### 4. **Fallback Strategy**
When AI service unavailable, provides:
- Plan → Execute → Review breakdown
- Time-based task splitting
- Basic but functional alternatives

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### User-Centric Design
- **Preview First**: Never surprise users with automatic changes
- **Clear Communication**: Every AI decision is explained
- **Beautiful UX**: Smooth animations and intuitive interface
- **Non-Intrusive**: Only shows AI options when beneficial

### AI Transparency
- **Reasoning Visible**: Users see why AI made recommendations
- **Confidence Scores**: Honest assessment of recommendation quality
- **Impact Assessment**: Clear explanation of expected benefits
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works even when AI is unavailable
