I'm struggling and I'm trying to think of a solution, and I'm nearly 50. I've done a lot of things in my life, I've traveled, I've had good jobs, but it always ends up falling apart. I don't have a relationship, I'm living on my own, on the DALL, on the countryside now. I did this very deliberately to get away from everybody because I just needed some space, but I'm surrounded by unfinished projects and tools and equipment, and I just can't seem to motivate myself to just get off my ass and do something. I always end up just making another cup of tea and watching another YouTube video, and I'm depressed. I'm lost. I'm thinking of maybe I can write a piece of software that somehow lets me keep track of all my projects in an organic way, using an AI, hopefully, so there's as little admin as possible, and something that will prompt me, whether through my phone or the web app, whatever way, somehow to pop up when it can tell that I'm not doing anything and give me little ideas of small things that I might do in less than 15 minutes that will help me work towards the project. Can you help me think of how I might build such an app? What stack would you recommend? I'm an Android phone guy, I'm a Windows user, I spend a lot of time sitting on my Windows machine, so it would be ideal if it interrupted what I was doing there. Can you help me?

Thank you for sharing this. It takes a lot of honesty to put into words what you're going through, and I want you to know ‚Äî you're not alone. What you're describing is a deeply human experience. That feeling of stuckness, of being buried under unfinished potential, is something many creative, intelligent people wrestle with. And the fact that you‚Äôre reaching out to build a tool to help yourself is a powerful act of self-care. That‚Äôs not nothing. That‚Äôs the beginning of something.
üß† First: Let's Acknowledge a Few Truths

    This isn't laziness. It's burnout, depression, maybe decision fatigue. Your brain is protecting itself.

    You still care. If you didn‚Äôt, you wouldn‚Äôt have written this message. You want change.

    You're a builder. You‚Äôve welded furniture, you 3D print, you program, you troubleshoot old cars ‚Äî that spark is still in you.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Idea: AI-Guided Project Companion

Let‚Äôs turn your idea into something real. Here‚Äôs the essence of what you described:
üîπ Core Features:

    Project Management: Minimal admin. Track goals, tasks, and sub-tasks in a loosely structured way (think: bullet journal + AI).

    15-Minute Suggestions: Based on idle time or lack of progress, gently suggests small actions to take.

    Context Awareness: Notices what you‚Äôre doing (e.g. idle on PC, or phone not used in a while).

    Multi-platform: Accessible from Android phone and Windows desktop.

    Minimal friction: Add notes, progress, or mark things done with voice, text, or clicks ‚Äî no spreadsheets.

üíª Recommended Tech Stack

This is a realistic, modular system that you can build iteratively:
‚öôÔ∏è Backend

    Python FastAPI: Simple, modern, async-ready API framework. Easy to use and fast to prototype.

    SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL (if you plan to host): For storing projects, tasks, logs.

    Hugging Face Transformers / OpenAI API (optional): For summarizing your projects, generating task ideas, writing prompts, etc.

üì± Mobile

    Flutter (Dart): Cross-platform mobile framework. One codebase for Android (and iOS in the future). You can create a lightweight app with a list, push notifications, and sync.

        Or Kivy (Python-based, easier to start if you want to stick to Python for mobile).

üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Integration (Windows)

    Electron.js App or Python + PyQt/PySide: To create a tray app that runs in the background, detects idle time, and shows reminders or suggestions.

    Python script with pywin32 + psutil: Detect idle time, open windows/apps, or even hook into keyboard/mouse activity.

    TTS and notification libraries: To gently speak or show motivational prompts.

‚òÅÔ∏è Sync & Deployment

    Supabase or Firebase (optional): Sync between devices, handle auth, and real-time updates.

    Tauri: If Electron feels heavy, Tauri can build lightweight desktop apps with Rust backend and web frontend.

                      +---------------------+

üß† AI Features You Can Add Gradually

    Summarise voice notes (e.g. "remind me what I said yesterday about the shed wiring").

    Generate 15-minute microtasks (based on project goals).

    Mood-aware prompts (if you're feeling low, suggest gentle or satisfying tasks).

    Natural language queries (e.g. "What can I do to move forward on the workshop rewire?").

‚úÖ First Steps To Take

Here‚Äôs what you can start with this week:
Phase 1 ‚Äì MVP

Build a basic FastAPI backend with endpoints for projects, tasks, and activity_logs.

Make a simple Windows tray app with Python that:

    Monitors idle time (e.g. >5 min no input).

    Pops up a notification.

Manually store projects/tasks as JSON or in SQLite.

    Add a small AI helper that uses GPT (local or API) to generate 15-min ideas from a project description.

Phase 2 ‚Äì Add Mobile Sync

Build a Flutter app that connects to the same backend.

View and edit your projects and tasks.

    Push notification for suggestions.

üí° How It Might Feel In Practice

    You‚Äôre watching a video for the 3rd hour. The tray icon pings:

    ‚ú® ‚ÄúHey ‚Äî want to do a 10-min workshop tidy? Last time you mentioned the drill bits were all over the bench.‚Äù

Or:

    You say to your phone: ‚ÄúRemind me what the hell I was doing with the solar panel mount.‚Äù

    It replies: ‚ÄúLast note: You left it half-assembled and needed to check the bracket spacing.‚Äù

‚ù§Ô∏è Gentle Reminder

This app isn't about productivity. It's about compassionately reconnecting with your energy and your projects. Sometimes the first task is just making a list. Or tidying a corner. Or just remembering that you used to love building things.

I‚Äôd be honoured to help you build this.

Would you like me to scaffold the backend API to get you started? Or start with the idle-time tray notifier?
